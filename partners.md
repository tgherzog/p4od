**[World Bank Group](http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do)** launched its Open Data policy in April
2010 by providing free and open access to a comprehensive set of
data for public use.  Recognizing that transparency and accountability are essential to the development process, the
Bank works with numerous partners to support governments in opening up their data to their citizens and the rest of the
world.  The Bank firmly believes that having broader access to data allows policy makers, researchers, citizens, and
students to better track the impact of policies, develop new solutions to public service delivery, and create new
sources of growth and employment.
