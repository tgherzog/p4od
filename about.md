The [World Bank Group](http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do),
the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/about-us) and 
[Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/about)
have joined forces in the creation of a global
partnership to help policy makers and citizens in developing countries understand and exploit the benefits of open data.
Initial funding of $1.25 million in the first year comes from The [World Bank's Development Grant Facility](http://go.worldbank.org/YV02K4PFI0). We are
actively seeking additional partners to join our efforts.

## Partnership Objectives

* **Supporting developing countries to plan, execute and run open data initiatives.** Officials in developing countries are
recognizing the potential impacts of open data. They are looking for a range of support to assess their current
readiness and to plan and execute national open data strategies.
* **Increase re-use of open data in developing countries.** Create data standards, guidelines, regional networks and
demand-side capacity. Data should be in a usable, well documented form, and there has to be an ecosystem of skills,
support and peer learning to help bring about social and economic innovation.
* **Grow the base of evidence on the impact of open data for development.** There needs to be a credible evidence base focused
on developing countries and socio-economic development in order to both win the support of officials and to better
execute future open data initiatives.

## POD Action Plan ## {#action-plan}

#### Scoping

Commission external individual or agency with expertise in both open data and
development to work with ODI, OKF and the World Bank to [complete a scoping study](resources.html#scoping-study)
in Year 1, Quarter 1 aimed at discovering:

* What are other institutions doing to support OD in developing countries
* Approximate amount of resources they allocate to support developing countries over a given time period
* What countries are they working with
* Whether they are already pursuing or planning to pursue activities similar to those below
* Whether they are interested to collaborate with POD to pursue joint activities.
* Mapping of open data activities in developing countries, either with outside support or independently.

#### Training

* Develop and deploy two training programmes for public sector servants, one for political leaders/decision makers on the
benefits of open government data for economic and social development, and another for open government data project
managers and participating public agencies.
* Develop and deploy training programme for civil society organizations, researchers, and others on the use of open data.

#### Research

* Develop and obtain consensus on a set of metrics for open data and apply them to 50 developing countries
* Collate/summarize existing research on the economic and social value of open data and create a virtual library
* Apps re-use: Identify common development problems solved creatively by open data, and the data sets and applications
used in these solutions

#### Technical Assistance

* Commission [Open Data Readiness
Assessments](http://data.worldbank.org/about/open-government-data-toolkit/readiness-assessment-tool) (ODRAs) in 4 developing countries
* ODI/OKF participation in ODRAs
* Provide technical assistance for the implementation of ODRAs or other technical assistance to developing countries

#### Guidelines

* Develop guidelines (including technical) for government departments and functions to release data in the open format
rapidly and for demand-side interventions
* Develop proposal and obtain consensus
