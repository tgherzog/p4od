This project is designed as a short-term website for the Partnership for Open Data, employing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org)
and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Implementation Notes ##

CSS development makes use of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), which Jekyll supports as of at least 2.0, but which is currently
not supported in the [version used by Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions) which is 1.5.1. Since Github Pages
has only limited plugin support, this creates a problem for what was intended to be a simple project with few (preferably no)
dependencies. Here's how the projects solves for that:

1. The site-wide CSS file (in Github Pages) is site.css, which is *not* explicitly generated by SASS
2. After each Jekyll build in the local environment, main.css must be copied from _site to the CSS source directory as shown below
3. If Jekyll results in different CSS output, git will detect that as a change to css/site.css. Use `git commit -a` to make sure this
   file is included
4. After a `git push` Github Pages will simply copy the site.css file to the output directory along with the other (redundant) source files

To ensure the master CSS file is kept up to date in Jekyll builds (step 2) you can run Jekyll via a script that looks like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    jekyll build 
    cp -f _site/css/main.css _site/css/site.css
    cp -f _site/css/site.css css/site.css
